At the isolation interface, a wind restraint system shall be provided to limit lateral displacement in the isolation system to a value equal to that required between floors of the structure above the isolation interface. (3) The fire resistance rating for the isolation system shall be consistent with the requirements of columns, walls, or other such elements in the same area of the structure. (4) The isolation system shall be configured to produce a lateral restoring force such that the lateral force at the total design displacement is at least 0.025 W greater than the lateral force at 50% of the total design displacement. (5) The isolation system shall not be configured to include a displacement restraint that limits lateral displacement due to the maximum considered earthquake to less than the total maximum displacement unless it is demonstrated by analysis that such engagement of restraint does not result in unsatisfactory performance of the structure. (6) Each element of the isolation system shall be designed to be stable under the design vertical load when subjected to a horizontal displacement equal to the total maximum displacement. (7) The factor of safety against global structural overturning at the isolation interface shall not be less than 1.0 for required load combinations. All gravity and seismic loading conditions shall be investigated. Seismic forces for overturning calculations shall be based on the maximum considered earthquake and the vertical restoring force shall be based on the seismic weight above the isolation interface.
